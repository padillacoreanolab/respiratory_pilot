    "Code for Merging Respiratory and Behavioral Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This script integrates respiratory recordings with behavioral event data to analyze respiratory dynamics during specific behavioral bouts. It processes raw data, synchronizes it with behavioral events, and performs analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow Explanation\n",
    "1. Import Libraries\n",
    "Essential libraries used in the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "tdt: Reads and processes TDT system data.\n",
    "\n",
    "neurokit2: Cleans and extracts features from respiratory signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy and pandas: Handle numerical computations and structured tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "matplotlib: Visualizes respiratory data alongside behavioral events.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Load Respiratory Data\n",
    "Purpose: Extract and prepare the respiratory signal for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Load respiratory signal data from the TDT block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract the signal and its sampling rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a time vector for synchronization and plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Process Respiratory Signal\n",
    "Purpose: Preprocess the respiratory signal for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "nk.rsp_clean: Cleans the raw respiratory signal to remove noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "nk.rsp_rate: Calculates respiratory rate (breaths per minute).\n",
    "\n",
    "signal_filter: Smooths the respiratory rate for improved clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome: A DataFrame containing time, respiratory rate, and cleaned signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extract Behavioral Bouts\n",
    "Purpose: Identify and extract periods of specific behavioral activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "A function identifies behavioral bouts based on input parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Subject: Specifies which subject(s) to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: Defines target behaviors (e.g., running, grooming).\n",
    "\n",
    "Filters:\n",
    "\n",
    "min_iti: Minimum time between bouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "min_bout: Minimum bout duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filters out irrelevant or short bouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Use: Demonstrates the extraction of \"running\" bouts for a specific subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Align Respiratory and Behavioral Data\n",
    "Purpose: Synchronize respiratory signals with behavioral bouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flag respiratory data points that occur during behavioral bouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the data into two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "In-bout data: Data points during behavioral events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-bout data: Data points outside behavioral events.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Analyze and Compare Data\n",
    "Purpose: Compare respiratory dynamics during and outside of behavioral bouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the average respiratory rate for in-bout and out-of-bout data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantify differences in respiratory behavior across contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Visualize Results\n",
    "Purpose: Present respiratory data and behavioral events visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the respiratory signal over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highlight behavioral bouts as shaded regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add labels, titles, and legends for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Export Data\n",
    "Purpose: Save processed data for further analysis or sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Exports a CSV file containing the merged respiratory and behavioral data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handles multiple subjects, behaviors, and experimental conditions by adjusting parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze amplitude or phase of the respiratory signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare respiratory dynamics across different behaviors or environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Highlighting behavioral bouts enhances interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides insights into the interaction between respiration and behavior over time."
